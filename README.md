# 🚀 MERN Stack Development Learning Repository

This repository is a structured guide to learning **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**.  
It contains notes, code snippets, mini-projects, and best practices to master full-stack web development.

## 📚 What is the MERN Stack?
The **MERN stack** is a popular set of technologies for building modern full-stack web applications:
- **MongoDB** → NoSQL database for storing application data.  
- **Express.js** → Backend framework for building APIs.  
- **React.js** → Frontend library for creating interactive user interfaces.  
- **Node.js** → Runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.  

## ✨ Features
- Step-by-step **learning path** for beginners.  
- **Code examples** for each technology.  
- Mini-projects for practice (CRUD, Auth, API integration).  
- Deployment guides using **Heroku, Vercel, and Netlify**.  
- Best practices for **clean code and project structure**.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub  


## 📖 Learning Path

1. **HTML, CSS, JS basics**
2. **Node.js & Express.js** (REST APIs)
3. **MongoDB + Mongoose** (database models)
4. **React.js** (components, hooks, state management)
5. **Full MERN projects** (Authentication, CRUD apps)
6. **Deployment & scaling**
